# ControlZit — working notes

Product: **ControlZit** (MaxZit RMM). Name confirmed by Stefan 2026-10-20.
Repository: github.com/Max-Zit/controlzit — **private** until Stefan says to make it public.
Local path: C:\Users\Mili\Ai\rmm

## Ground rules
- Totally separate from BackupZit (no shared code/agent/database); ideas may be re-implemented.
- No dependency on other open-source products/services; plain Go libraries are fine.
- Commits as stefanzeljkic only, no AI attribution; stage explicit paths.
- Secrets only in credentials.txt (gitignored), never printed or committed.

## Decisions
- 2026-10-20: name ControlZit; private GitHub repo Max-Zit/controlzit.
- 2026-10-20: license AGPLv3 (like BackupZit) + paid support; add LICENSE before going public.
- 2026-10-20: architecture confirmed (Go server + PostgreSQL, Go Windows agent, outbound TLS, pinned cert).
- 2026-10-20: agent port and management console port MUST be separate listeners so the agent port can be isolated on the firewall; expose both (address/port, LAN-only, allowed IP ranges) as options in Settings.
- 2026-10-20: feature order confirmed: 1 server skeleton, 2 agent/inventory, 3 monitoring/alerts, 4 remote actions, 5 patching, 6 remote desktop, 7 reports.
- Brand: same design as BackupZit/MaxZit (indigo square, white line symbol, Inter SemiBold, "Zit" in indigo). brandgen got a `controlzit [a|b|c]` mode (maxzit-brand/tools/brandgen/controlzit.go).

## Open questions for Stefan
- Pick icon a (monitor + pulse), b (circuit C) or c (control hub) — full sets in maxzit-brandnceptsntrolzit{a,b,c}. Then copy the chosen set to maxzit-brandntrolzit-logo and into the repo.

## Status
- Repo created (README, NOTES, .gitignore).
- 3 logo/icon proposals generated, waiting for Stefan to pick.

## Next steps
- Server skeleton: setup, admin with mandatory TOTP, argon2id, sessions, IP allow-list on the management listener, customers/sites/devices, enrollment tokens.
